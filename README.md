### Run the project

Copy the `.env-example` file to `.env` and add the following values: 

- REACT_APP_BASE_URL - the URL of the server that handles the requests

First you have to run `npm install` and then `npm start`. 
Please note that the backend instance (the base URL from the env) must be started so we can fetch data and send requests.
